In the web application, you'll find:

- a Google document with step-by-step instructions
- an embedded CodeSandbox (ready to fork for workshop attendees) with the code for the MongoDB Netflix Clone found at www.atlassearchmovies.com (https://github.com/khuaulme/AtlasSearchWorkshop2022)

<p> By building out the MongoDB Netflix Clone application, you'll demonstrate all sorts of  complex, fine-grained full-text searches on your Atlas data.</p>

Current features implemented in this Movie Search Engine demo application include:

- fuzzy matching
- highlighting
- autocomplete
- relevance-based scoring
- custom function scoring

Future Atlas Search features to implement can include:

- [ ] facets
- [ ] synonyms

<h2 align="center"><a href="netflixclone-xwaaq.mongodbstitch.com/">www.atlassearchmovies.com</a></h2>

<p>The movie search application was created using:</p>

- React
- MongoDB Realm for backend HTTPs endpoints and webhooks
- The Atlas sample dataset of sample_mflix.movies

<h3>API Points of Integration</h3>
This application is hosted entirely on Realm and calls 2 API endpoints:
 
 * getProductsEndpoint in the Home.js page on line 24
 * Suggestions_AC_Endpoint, used for autocompleted product names, in the Header.js component on line 17.

<p><em>Currently this app is not suitable for mobile, but feel free to send a PR.</em> ðŸ˜Š</p>

<h3>Attendee Prerequisites:</h3>
